# ServingSmart AI

An AI-powered training platform for restaurants that eliminates setup friction and accelerates staff development.

## Vision

Create a learning management tool that requires almost no human effort to set up, helping restaurants improve service quality, reduce costly errors, increase sales revenue, reduce turnover costs, and empower servers to advance their careers.

## Approach

Following Lean Startup methodology with empirical testing to validate hypotheses and direct development. Currently in **customer discovery phase**.

## Current Phase: Problem Validation

We're conducting 20-30 customer interviews with sit-down restaurants to:
1. Validate training pain points and quantify costs
2. Test willingness to pay for systematic training solutions
3. Identify beachhead customer segment (fine dining, casual, or fast casual)
4. Determine MVP feature priorities
5. Recruit 2-3 pilot customers

## Value Proposition

### For Restaurant Management
- Almost zero setup effort (AI generates training content from existing menus)
- Reduce training time by 40-50% (12 weeks → 7 weeks)
- Cut costly errors by 30-40% through systematic knowledge testing
- Real-time visibility into staff knowledge and training gaps
- Measurable ROI through error reduction and sales lift

### For Servers & Support Staff
- Confidence in guest interactions through comprehensive menu knowledge
- Increased sales ability → higher tips and income
- Clear advancement pathways from busser → server → lead server
- Gamified learning that's engaging vs. traditional manuals
- Improved job satisfaction and professional development

## Target Segments (Under Validation)

1. **Fine Dining Restaurants** - Complex menus, high service standards, longer training cycles
2. **Casual Dining** - Multi-location standardization needs, moderate complexity
3. **Fast Casual** - High turnover, simpler training but large volume

**Beachhead selection:** To be determined after customer discovery (Week 3-4)

## Revenue Model (Hypothesis)

- Per-user monthly subscription: $15-25/employee/month
- Target contract value: $5K-10K annually per restaurant location
- Validated through customer interviews measuring willingness to pay vs. quantified pain

## Next Milestones

- [ ] Complete 20-30 customer discovery interviews
- [ ] Select beachhead segment based on pain intensity + WTP
- [ ] Recruit 2-3 pilot customers
- [ ] Build MVP (menu knowledge quizzes, manager dashboard, mobile interface)
- [ ] Run 8-week pilot and measure outcomes
- [ ] Validate that platform improves measurable metrics (error rates, training time, sales)
