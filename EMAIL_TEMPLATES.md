## Template 1: Initial Outreach - Interview Request

**Subject Line Options** (A/B test these):
- `Quick question about training at {{restaurant_name}}`
- `{{first_name}}, how do you train new servers?`
- `10 minutes to discuss server training?`
- `Research on restaurant training - can I ask you 3 questions?`

**Email Body:**

```
Hi {{first_name}},

I'm Cameron Powell, and I'm researching how {{category}} restaurants handle server training and onboarding. I'm talking to GMs and owners in {{location}} to understand the biggest challenges.

Would you be open to a quick 10-minute conversation about your training process? Specifically:

• How long does it take to get a new server fully productive?
• What are the most common mistakes or knowledge gaps?
• How do you currently test menu knowledge?

I'm building a tool to help restaurants streamline training, and your insights would be invaluable. I'm happy to share what I'm learning from other restaurants as well.

Are you available for a brief call this week? I'm flexible on timing - happy to work around your schedule.

Best,
Cameron Powell

[Your Phone] | [Your Email]

P.S. This is pure research - not selling anything at this stage. Just trying to understand the problem deeply.
```

**Why this works:**
- Personalized with their specific details
- Clear value exchange (insights for their time)
- Low commitment (10 minutes)
- Specific questions show you've thought about their business
- P.S. removes sales pressure

## Template 2: Follow-up #1 - Soft Bump (3 days later)

**Subject Line:**
- `Re: Quick question about training at {{restaurant_name}}`
- `Following up - server training research`

**Email Body:**

```
Hi {{first_name}},

I know you're busy running {{restaurant_name}}, so I'll keep this brief.

I sent a note earlier this week about restaurant training research. I'm talking to {{category}} managers about how they onboard servers and handle menu knowledge training.

If you have 10 minutes this week for a quick chat, I'd love to hear your perspective. No sales pitch - just trying to understand the challenges.

Would {{day}} or {{day}} work for a brief call?

Thanks,
Cameron

## Template 3: Follow-up #2 - Value-Add + Ask (7 days later)

**Subject Line:**
- `Insight from other {{category}} restaurants`
- `What I'm learning about server training`

**Email Body:**

```
Hi {{first_name}},

I've been interviewing {{category}} restaurant managers about training, and I wanted to share an interesting pattern I'm seeing:

**Most restaurants are spending $1,200-2,500/month on training-related costs** (errors, manager time, early turnover) without realizing it. The average time to get a server fully productive is 8-12 weeks.

I'm curious if this matches your experience at {{restaurant_name}}?

If you're open to a brief 10-minute conversation about your training process, I'd love to compare notes. I'm happy to share more insights from what I'm learning across the industry.

Available this week if you are.

Best,
Cameron

## Template 4: Follow-up #3 - Final Attempt (14 days later)

**Subject Line:**
- `Last try - server training research`
- `Closing out research - final invite`

**Email Body:**

```
Hi {{first_name}},

I'm wrapping up my research phase on restaurant training this week, and I wanted to reach out one last time before I close my interview list.

I've spoken with {{number}} restaurant managers so far, and the insights have been incredible. Common themes:
• 6-12 week onboarding timelines
• $500-1,000/month in preventable errors
• No good way to track who knows what

If you'd like to contribute to the research (and hear what I'm learning), I have a few spots left this week for quick 10-minute calls.

If not, no worries at all - I'll keep you posted on what we build from all this feedback.

Either way, best of luck with {{restaurant_name}}!

## Template 6: Pilot Program Invitation (Hot Leads Only)

**Subject Line:**
- `Pilot program invitation - {{restaurant_name}}`
- `{{first_name}}, let's solve your training challenge`

**Email Body:**

```
Hi {{first_name}},

Thanks again for the great conversation last week. Based on what you shared about {{their_specific_pain}}, I think {{restaurant_name}} would be a perfect fit for our pilot program.

Here's what I'm building:

**Restaurant Training Platform** - Menu knowledge quizzes, auto-generated content, manager dashboard

**Your specific benefits:**
• Reduce your {{X}}-week training time by 40-50%
• Cut errors from {{their_error_rate}} to nearly zero through systematic menu knowledge testing
• Track exactly who knows what - no more guesswork
• Mobile-friendly for your staff to use anywhere, anytime

**Pilot Program Details:**
• Timeline: {{8 weeks starting DATE}}
• Investment: ${{discounted_price}}/month for {{team_size}} staff (50% off standard pricing)
• Commitment: Use it actively, provide weekly feedback, share results if successful
• My commitment: Weekly check-ins, rapid iteration based on your needs, dedicated support

**What I need from you:**
• Access to your current menu and training materials
• Weekly 20-min feedback sessions
• Staff engagement (encourage your team to use it)
• Honest feedback - tell me what works and what doesn't

I'm limiting the pilot to 3-5 restaurants so I can provide hands-on support. Based on our conversation and the pain you're experiencing with {{specific_pain}}, I think we can deliver real ROI quickly.

Interested? Let's schedule a 30-minute call to walk through the details and answer any questions.

I have availability:
• {{Day}}, {{Time}}
• {{Day}}, {{Time}}
• {{Day}}, {{Time}}

Or suggest a time that works better for you.

Looking forward to partnering with {{restaurant_name}}!

Best,
Cameron

## Template 8: Re-engagement - 3 Months Later

**Subject Line:**
- `Results from pilot restaurants`
- `{{first_name}}, we have data now`

**Email Body:**

```
Hi {{first_name}},

We spoke a few months ago about restaurant training challenges. I wanted to share results from our pilot program since you were curious about this space.

**Pilot Results (8 weeks, 3 restaurants):**
• Average training time: **12 weeks → 7 weeks** (42% reduction)
• Server errors: **30-40% reduction** across all pilot sites
• Manager time on training: **15 hours/month → 6 hours/month**
• Staff engagement: **78% of servers used platform 2+ times/week voluntarily**

One pilot customer ({{category}} restaurant, {{size}} staff) calculated $1,800/month in savings from error reduction alone.

We're opening up 10 spots for our next cohort. Based on our earlier conversation about {{their_pain}}, I thought you might be interested.

Want to see a demo or discuss how this might work for {{restaurant_name}}?

Let me know - happy to jump on a quick call.

Best,
Cameron

- Social proof from similar restaurants
- Low-friction CTA (demo video)
- Reminds them of their pain

## Personalization Variables to Track

For each prospect, maintain these data points in your spreadsheet:

**Required:**
- `{{first_name}}` - Manager's first name
- `{{restaurant_name}}` - Name of restaurant
- `{{category}}` - Fine dining / Casual dining / Fast casual
- `{{location}}` - City or neighborhood

**Optional (gathered during research):**
- `{{team_size}}` - Number of servers/staff
- `{{their_pain}}` - Specific challenge they mentioned
- `{{error_rate}}` - Errors per week/month
- `{{training_time}}` - Current weeks to productivity
- `{{interesting_detail}}` - Something unique about their restaurant

**The more you personalize, the higher your response rate.**

---

## Email Sequence Strategy

### For Cold Prospects:
1. **Day 0**: Initial outreach
2. **Day 3**: Follow-up #1 (if no response)
3. **Day 7**: Follow-up #2 with value-add (if no response)
4. **Day 14**: Follow-up #3 final attempt (if no response)
5. **Move to nurture list** (monthly check-ins)

### For Respondents:
1. **Immediately**: Thank you + schedule interview
2. **Post-interview**: Thank you + key takeaways
3. **Within 1 week**: Pilot invitation (if hot lead) or nurture (if warm)

### For Pilot Participants:
1. **Weekly**: Check-in during pilot
2. **End of pilot**: Results summary + conversion ask
3. **Post-conversion**: Onboarding sequence (separate from this)

---

## A/B Testing Plan

**Test these variables to optimize:**

### Subject Lines:
- Question vs. Statement
- Personalized vs. Generic
- Short (3-5 words) vs. Longer (8-12 words)

### Email Length:
- Short (5 sentences) vs. Medium (3 paragraphs)

### CTA:
- "Available for a call?" vs. "Here are 3 times that work"
- Open-ended vs. Specific ask

### Send Time:
- Morning (9-11am) vs. Afternoon (2-4pm)
- Tuesday vs. Wednesday vs. Thursday

**Track open rate, reply rate, and meeting booking rate for each variation.**

---

## Response Templates (For Common Replies)

### "Not interested right now"
```
Totally understand, {{first_name}}. Thanks for letting me know.

If anything changes or you'd like to see what we build, feel free to reach out anytime. Best of luck with {{restaurant_name}}!

Cameron
```

### "Can you send me more info?"
```
Absolutely! Here's a quick overview:

[2-3 sentence pitch + link to one-pager or demo video]

Would a 15-minute call help? I can walk through how it works and answer questions. Available {{times}} if that's easier.

Cameron
```

### "Sounds interesting but timing is bad"
```
No problem at all - I totally get it.

When would be a better time to revisit? I can follow up in {{timeframe}} if that works.

In the meantime, I'll keep you posted on progress and results from pilot restaurants.

Thanks!
Cameron
```

### "What does it cost?"
```
Great question. For a restaurant your size ({{team_size}} staff), it would be around ${{price}}/month.

That said, I'm more focused on making sure it actually solves your problem first. Would you be open to a quick call to discuss your training challenges? Then I can give you a more accurate estimate based on your specific needs.

Available this week if you are.

Cameron
```
