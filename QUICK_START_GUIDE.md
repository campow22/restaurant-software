---

## ❓ Decision Trees

### "Should I keep interviewing or start building?"

**Keep Interviewing if:**
- Less than 20 interviews completed
- No clear segment winner yet
- Fewer than 3 hot leads
- Feature priorities still unclear

**Start Building if:**
- 20+ interviews done
- Clear beachhead segment selected
- 3+ pilot commitments
- Top 3 MVP features validated
- WTP confirms viable business model

---

### "Should I pivot my segment/approach?"

**Consider Pivoting if:**
- After 30 interviews, less than 30% express strong interest
- WTP is consistently below $10/user (won't support business)
- Different segment shows 3x more enthusiasm
- Core assumption invalidated (e.g., they don't care about menu knowledge)

**Persevere if:**
- Strong interest from target segment (even if small number)
- Clear WTP at or above target price
- Solvable objections (e.g., "show me proof it works")
- Problem intensity is high (quantified pain)

## 📈 What Success Looks Like (Week 4)

- ✅ Top 3 MVP features: "Menu quizzes, manager dashboard, mobile"
- ✅ 2-3 pilot restaurants committed
- ✅ Pilot start date scheduled (e.g., 4 weeks from now)
- ✅ MVP specification ready to build

**At that point:** We shift from validation to building. I'll help you:
- Design the MVP architecture
- Prioritize features for 8-week pilot
- Build the initial version
